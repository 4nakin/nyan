Run NyanCat!
============

About
-----

Silly 2D game written in C++ with SFML so its supposed to be multi-platform but good luck compiling 
it on Windows. Have g++ installed and run "make" and hopefully you'll have a binary :)

Objective
---------

For reasons untold nyancat is hanging around a picturesque 8-bit landscape being chased by zombies to the 
Benny Hill soundtrack. You're goal is to stay alive as long as you can (sorry you can't fight back...yet). 
Basically it's a pinball game type setup, you can't beat it but try to stay alive as long as you can; and
have umm... bragging rights to all the others (2) who play this game. ("Ha! I made it 32.432 seconds in the
famous 'Run NyanCat!' game!!!").

Whatever, show me the screens
